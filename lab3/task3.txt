Task to do: Laboratory work №3

MACHINE LEARNING METHODS.

For the given system (Lab №1(4)), create datasets (e.g., using the Python package - scikit-learn) or use existing ones from resources like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, etc. to implement one of the machine learning methods (choice of: classification methods, clustering methods, regression methods).

Perform data cleaning and preparation, including removal of unnecessary features, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, feature scaling, etc. Since machine learning algorithms do not know how to process words, and it is also not advisable to transform all data using label encoding, as numerical data also contain valuable information, it is necessary to use a combination of label encoders and unprocessed numerical data.

For classification and regression methods, split the dataset into training and testing sets. Feed the training data into the model for training using learning methods.

Evaluate the effectiveness of the trained model using metrics on the testing dataset. After the model is trained and its effectiveness is confirmed, use it for classification, clustering, or prediction of new data entering the system.

I used the Decision Tree Classifier method for this task.

The system created is named "Attractions Route Recommendation System."
